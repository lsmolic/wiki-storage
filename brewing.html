<h1>Brewing</h1>
<p>Sake is a brewed beverage. That means it is far similar to beer than it is to wine, with which it is often confused. In fact there is an entirely different product called <i>rice wine</i> that is used in lots of Asian cuisine, but if you drink that you'll quickly see how it differs from the incredible drink we call Sake.</p>

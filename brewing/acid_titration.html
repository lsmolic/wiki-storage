<p><strong>Why measure the acidity of sake?</strong></p>
<p>Apart from acidity’s obvious effect on taste, the acidity level is often listed on sake labels so it can be an interesting point of comparison. Acids balance out sugars and other components via our taste buds, so evaluating acidity alongside SMV and alcohol content adds context to the overall profile of a sake.</p>
<p>Acid testing by titration is simple and inexpensive to do. It requires a handful of supplies that are easy to obtain from a winemaking supply store.</p>
<p><strong>List of supplies</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>clear plastic or glass container, 20-50mL</li>
  <li>10mL filtered sake sample</li>
  <li>1mL syringe</li>
  <li>10mL syringe</li>
  <li>phenolphthalein indicator and eye dropper or plastic pipette</li>
  <li>0.1M or 0.2M NaOH solution</li>
</ul>

<p>The sake sample should be reasonably clear (low cloudiness) for best results. It is important to be able to view all the way through the sample to judge the color change of the indicator. If the sample is cloudy, allow it to sit longer to settle and then use the clear portion for testing.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can set aside a second untreated sample in a similar container as a reference to judge the color change during titration.</p>
<p><strong>Steps for titration</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Set up a work area where any spills will be easy to clean up, and place the sample container(s) on a white plate or white piece of paper as a background.</li>
  <li>Draw up 10mL of sake using a syringe, making sure to get rid of any bubbles. Transfer the full 10mL into the clean and dry sample container(s).</li>
  <li>Add 3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator to the sake sample.</li>
  <li>Draw up 1mL of the base solution: NaOH (Sodium Hydroxide).</li>
  <li>Begin dropping the base solution into the sample jar. Pink spots will immediately form. Swirl the jar and the pink hue will quickly disappear.</li>
  <li>As more base is added the color will take noticeably longer to fade away. At this point start adding a single drop at a time, swirling for up to 15 seconds until the color changes back to the original sake color. If the sample is still clear after adding 1mL, draw up another 1mL and continue dropping.</li>
  <li>At the point when the color does not change back after swirling the titration is complete. Record how many mL of base was used in total. For example, if a full 1mL of 0.1M solution was used and there was 0.2mL remaining from the second fill of the syringe, a total of 1.0 + (1.0-0.2) = 1.8mL was used. The san-do of your sample is 1.8.</li>
</ul>

<p>The mL of 0.1M NaOH used to titrate a 10mL sample is defined as the san-do (酸度 ). If using 0.2M NaOH, the san-do is 2x the mL of base solution used. San-do is listed on some sake bottles, and if it does you will always see it shown without units. It is proportional to total acidity, and can be converted to total acidity by multiplying the san-do by 0.59 to get the equivalent g/L as succinic acid. This second value is not normally used in the sake industry.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced tips and discussion</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you have a pH meter available try using it as a point of reference to recognize the color gradations as the indicator darkens. Once familiar with the process a pH meter is not required since the indicator is there for this exact purpose.</li>
  <li>Try a titration with a commercial sake and compare your value against the number printed on the label.</li>
  <li>Below is a titration curve for succinic acid, a primary acid in sake. The shape of the curve is typical for a weak acid reacting with a strong base. The sharp change in pH from 8.0-10.0 (the mid-point of which is called the 'equivalence point') is a reasonable match for the working range of the phenolphthalein indicator (8.5-10.0). Since we are aiming for the 8.5-9.0 pH range, it is best to stop the titration when there is just a minor change in tint that persists after stirring. If a deep pink color results, the titration went too far and should be repeated to get a more accurate result.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>This diagram leads us to a significant catch in the process though – sake contains many types of acid, not just succinic acid. Malic, lactic, citric, and acetic acid are all found in sake in varying amounts. What this means for titration is that multiple curves are ‘combined’ in our samples, each with its own equivalence point. So rather than a sharp pH increase at a single point we instead see a slow climb in pH as the titration proceeds. This is reflected by the slow change of the indicator color when titrating sake samples, so we must select our indicator type and end point more carefully.</li>
  <li>The chart below was produced using a home brewed sake sample, and titration progress was tracked using a pH meter. While each sake will have a different curve, this shows that a large spread in measured acidity is possible depending on the choice of endpoint for the titration.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Sake brewers use a <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_s/16.html">combined indicator</a>, which covers a lower pH range than phenolphthalein and addresses the blended acid problem. <a href="https://www.tcichemicals.com/IN/en/p/N1190">Bromothymol Blue plus Neutral Red</a> has a working pH range of 6.0-8.0 so the <a href="https://sakestreet.com/ja/media/how-to-read-data-on-sake-labels">standardized neutralization point</a> of pH 7.2 can be easily identified. This produces lower values overall than would be result from using phenolphthalein. The combined indicator used in Japan is hard to source, however aquarium pH indicator drops are readily available, and these cover much of the same range.</li>
  <li>When learning to titrate, checking the results against a calibrated pH meter is a good idea for all the reasons mentioned above.</li>

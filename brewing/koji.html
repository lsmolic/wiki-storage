<h1>Koji</h1>
<p>Koji ( 麹,. chinese - qú ) is the name for any substrate that has had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_oryzae">Aspergillus Oryzae</a> mold grown on it. This mold has been cultivated for thousands of years and produces some amazing tastes that have defined Asian cooking, and when we specifically talk about Japan, it is responsible for what is often described as the ‘umami’ flavor.</p>
<p>In sake brewing, <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_k/104.html"><i>koji-kin</i></a> (麹菌), or <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_t/106.html">tane-koji</a> (<u>種麹)</u>as it is also referred, is a spore that is spread out over freshly steamed rice. Over 40-55 hours, using heat and temperature control, the koji-kin will grow into a small fungus that spreads over the surface of the grains. When a soft-looking fuzz appears over all the grains, we refer to this moldy rice as <i>koji.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Koji-kin, the reproductive spore we use to inoculate, is produced by mature Koji when it is in its final stages of growth and to date, only about 7-10 companies in the world produce Koji-kin for purchase, as quality control and strain selection is an extremely difficult art.</p>
<p>If you are curious to learn more, the <a href="https://www.soyinfocenter.com/">Soyinfo Center</a> released a comprehensive study about the <a href="https://www.soyinfocenter.com/pdf/154/Koji.pdf">history of koji</a>. There is also a growing wiki mentioned a few times on this site, which contains a <a href="http://www.kojiwiki.com/index.php/Glossary">koji glossary</a>, among other resources that can help further your understanding on this topic.</p>

<h6>Types of Sake Koji</h6>
<p>You can purchase <a href="/brewing/materials">pre-made Koji</a> from online distributors and there are many <a href="http://www.kojiwiki.com/index.php/Resources">koji resources</a> on making various types of koji, but within the world of sake there are a few that we want to focus on because they will produce the types of enzymes that are most beneficial to the fermentation process.</p>

<h6>Making Koji for Sake</h6>
<p>Koji can be made for many reasons and there are many people aggregating information on that topic in a separate <a href="http://www.kojiwiki.com/">wiki</a>. Rather than have the <a href="http://www.kojiwiki.com/index.php/Koji_making_for_sake">recipe for Sake Koji</a> deviate, we maintain that information there, but will continue to add relevant data and variations on this site because our topic is so much more focused.</p>

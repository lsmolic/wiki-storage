<h2><strong>Process Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Sake is a brewed beverage, using a different process than beer, and should also not be confused with wine making. If you want to learn more, see <a href="/brewing">Sake Brewing: Overview</a>.</p>
<p>The process begins by harvesting, milling, and polishing rice down to a specified percentage. After polishing, the rice is left to absorb ambient moisture from the air, a process referred to as <i>karashi</i>.</p>
<p>The Tōji will conduct tests on the rice to determine how long to soak the rice for and then the task of washing, steeping, and finally steaming the rice begins. They are exhaustive tasks which repeat each day during the sake brewing season. About 25-35% of the rice is then taken into a special room called the koji-mura, where it will be used to make Koji.</p>
<p>For 2-4 weeks a small portion of koji, rice, yeast, and water will be fermented in a relatively small container (1/10 - 1/8th the total size) which will allow yeast cells to replicate and prepare for the immense quadrupling of volume to come. When this <i>moto</i>, also known as <i>shubo</i> (酒母 - lit. “sake mother”) is ready, it is placed into a much larger container and for 3 days koji, rice, and water are added, doubling the size each day, until the main fermentation begins.</p>
<p>This main fermentation, known in beer as the <i>mash</i>, is referred to as the <i>moromi.</i> The moromi will be closely monitored over 25-55 days, as the temperature rises naturally, but also using various warming and cooling methods, to achieve the desired flavors, aromas, and alcohol levels. Just before the fermentation is complete, there are a few optional steps that can be completed at this time. A fourth-addition, to add sweetness, and also brewer's alcohol, which can be used to achieve specific flavors and body.</p>
<p>When the main fermentation is complete, the moromi is pressed using one of several methods and the resulting liquid is sake. As fresh as it gets. The remaining sediments are removed using racking methods similar to other brewing processes, and then there are a number of optional steps such as micro-filtering and pasteurization.</p>
<p>Sake will usually stay in a cool room, in a bottle or stored in tanks for months before being shipped.</p>
<p>We will go into exhaustive detail about these processes below and in sub-pages, links, and images so you have an idea of what this should look like and how it all comes together. As a home-brewer, you might find that many images don't always match what you will be working with. We'll do our best to give both examples so you can see how that</p>
<h2>Step By Step</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Rice Growing</strong></h6>
<p>Even before a single <a href="https://www.urbansake.com/sake-101/sake-glossary/kurabito/">kura-bito</a> puts their hands on a single grain of rice, there are many farmers, companies, organizations, and even governments involved in producing rice that will eventually end up in a sake brewery or “sakagura” (蔵). Rice is one of the oldest cultivated crops in the world and as such, humans have found plenty of ways to improve upon varieties: hybrids, selective cultivation, genetic engineering, etc. There are rice paddies that have even found a symbiotic relationship with ducks to eliminate pests and of course one of the earliest developments most of us are aware of is flooding the fields to prevent other plants from growing and protect the stalks from potential predators.</p>
<p>In Japan, the Japonica rice varietal has been crossbred and selectively grown for so long that there are over a hundred sake rice varieties currently grown today. For a detailed description of these, see <a href="/education/resources">Resources: Rice</a></p>
<p>Rice growing seasons vary, and that can actually be a factor in choosing what kind of rice to use. For Japanese brewers and even those in the United States, Yamada Nishiki is by far the most popular. Details such as shorter growing season will mean that the chance of a crop not falling victim to a typhoon or other natural disaster is far less. The size and shape of the grain is analyzed. The moisture content of the grain at harvest can even be a factor in the final selection.</p>
<p>Size and shape of the grain play a huge roll in the potential of the sake it will produce because of the biological and chemical makeup of a rice grain. Lipids (fats), Proteins, and Starches are the key components that can greatly affect an ability to make quality Koji, provide sugars for the yeast, and cold produce wanted (and unwanted) flavors and aromas.</p>
<p>Even the weather can effect the ultimate sake quality and properties. Experienced brewers have to account for these challenges in the following steps and it is the most skilled that will produce award winning sake.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of rice being grown and harvested:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Rice Milling &amp; Polishing</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Milling</strong></p>
<p><strong>The purpose of Milling is </strong>to remove the husk of the grain, germ, and 10% of the outer layer that makes all rice brown from the start.</p>
<p>When rice is harvested from a field, it is very similar to most other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal">cereal</a> grains like wheat, millet, barley, oats, or corn. It needs to have the husk of the grain removed, which is expectedly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_huller">rice husking or rice hulling</a> and the technology has improved markedly over the years from hand husking against a rough stone, to machines which can not only hull the grain, but will remove dirt, and separate out the broken grains so that the final product is extremely pure in whole grains. Usually, in addition to the initial husk, about 10% of the grain is also removed. Most people will be surprised to know that all rice is originally brown rice and by taking away this initial percentage of the grain (the bran layer) we expose the white portion, far less rich in proteins and lipids than with the husk present. In sake production, this portion of the process is known as milling. From here, other machines will remove more of the grain as specified by the brewer. Some brewers even have their own on-site machines to do this on site.</p>
<p>Here is an example in Japan of rice milling at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr-eRU8WQgg">JRE</a> and another from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhA1GlH-cU0">Isabel Farms</a> in the US</p>
<p><strong>Polishing</strong></p>
<p><strong>The purpose of Polishing </strong>is to carefully take away smaller and smaller amounts of the grain which contain less desirable minerals, proteins, and lipids that would produce off flavors and aromas in the final beverage.</p>

<p><span class="text-tiny">Levels of Polishing: (</span><a href="https://web-japan.org/nipponia/nipponia44/en/feature/feature05.html"><span class="text-tiny">source</span></a><span class="text-tiny">)</span></p>
<p><br>Once the milling being and as the polishing machines take over to complete the work, the remaining percentage of rice is stated using the term <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_s/84.html">seimai buai</a> (精米歩合). It literally means “rice polishing ratio”. For most high-quality sake, it usually ends up being 40-85% remaining. Meaning 15-60% of the rice has been removed. The number usually starts around 90%, which is what the milling company produces, before it begins the polishing process.</p>
<p>This simple choice of made by the <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_t/437.html">Tōji</a> on “how much of the grain to keep”, will effect just about every stage of the process to come, impacting timing, temperatures, acidity, taste, aroma, composition, food paring, marketing, and many other aspects.</p>
<p>Polishing is a very complicated process, and only about 2 companies in the world specialize in machinery that can polish rice. Since 1575, the technology has been improving, and in the early 1900s, it became possible to remove 40% of the rice, giving birth to a highly-refined (clean taste) sake. 60% seimai buai (40% removed) would become known later as Ginjo sake and is one of the main reasons this section's importance can not be understated. Breweries have in fact managed to produce sake with &lt;1% seimai buai, which, if you consider the physics of removing that much rice, means you need to use almost 100x as much rice to produce the same amount of sake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Karashi ("resting" after polishing)</strong></h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of the Karashi period</strong> is to accumulate moisture lost during the polishing process. The reason this requirement exists at all is due to how much heat is generated during the polishing process as the grains rub against the grinding stone and each other. The extra heat causes the moisture to evaporate out of the rice, but this also means the grains are more brittle as a result.</p>
<p>This is a time of 2-14 days that brewers let newly polished rice sit in porous ~50Lb bags (22.6kg) in the open air in the factory. By allowing them to rest for a few days, they will absorb this moisture back into the grains and at that point the Toji can decide if they are ready to begin washing. Usually they will measure the moisture in the grains to see if it has returned to about 13-18%, which is equivalent to about how much is in them when they are harvested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Rice Washing (</strong><a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_s/94.html">洗米</a> sen-mai)</h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of rice washing</strong> is to remove the rice brain (nuka) that accumulates during the polishing process. Nuka contains minerals, proteins, and lipids which will produce undesirable flavors and aromas in the fermentation process. The presence of nuka would also make the rice stickier and more difficult to work with.</p>
<p>Important Details:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rice: polishing amount (seimai buai), moisture content, storage temperature</li>
  <li>Water: temperature, mineral content</li>
</ul>
<p>Washing the rice is the next critical step, especially when dealing with highly polished rice. If you were to make rice at home for cooking, it is usually recommended to wash it several times, allowing the water to drain and then repeat a few times before moving on to the cooking phase. This is because of the sediments, milling powder, and other potential flour-like material that is clinging to the rice from the milling process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At home, this process isn't very risky due to the low amount of polishing that table/sushi rice has. 90% seimai buai usually will take quite a while to absorb water, so you might wash for 10 minutes and that would not really effect the outcome. However, in the world of sake brewing, with rice that has been polished much more (only 35-70% remaining), the process becomes a time-critical experience that many commercial breweries actually use automated machines. This is because how quickly the soft, starchy center of sake rice absorbs water, compared to the protein and lipid rich outer layers.</p>
<p>With the steps that follow, the importance of water absorption rate will becoming increasingly clear, especially as you try to make your own koji. Brewers attempt to hit a total water content of 28-34% in the rice. With highly polished rice, the absorption rate could be so fast that after just 1-3 minutes it goes from 15% to 25%. If you took 10 minutes to wash, this would actually cause the rice to absorb all the necessary water, but it could actually absorb MORE than is desired, leading to soggy grains, which is absolutely the worst state a grain can be in heading into steaming or koji making.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that water temperature will play a huge role here as well. You want to try to reduce the amount of grains that split open (crack) during washing and steeping. One huge component of that is ensuring that the temperature of the water matches the temperature of the rice (usually these fall within 8-12°C) The homogenous environment greatly reduces the likelihood of the sudden exposure to cold temps cracking the rice.</p>
<p>Another key factor is actually how the rice is washed. While it might feel natural to move your hands rigorously, it is far more of a gentle motion, simply to free the stuck powder, and not to induce any intense rubbing together of the grains, which could lead to cracking as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Determining the Water Absorption Rate</i></p>
<p>Usually the head-brewer, or who ever is skilled in this particular task of judging the water absorption, will take a small sample of each batch of rice that came from the polisher and do an absorption test with a stop-watch. Theoretically all the rice of a particular varietal was being polished at the same time, was also from the same field, and also had the same polishing rate, so it should react the same to water. Any variation in these should have separate tests to determine how each batch will absorb water differently.</p>
<p>To conduct this test, the brewer will place rice grains on a small black plate or cup ( dark color is for contrast against the white rice ) and start a stop-watch as soon as it is immersed in water. The experience of the brewer is such that they can almost tell the exact moment the rice has absorbed enough, just by the sight of it:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.clipkit.co/tenants/820/articles/images/000/000/182/original/12153bed-1929-42ef-8e8c-b6bda1ef31a7.jpg?1602048421">[insert image of rice at point of finished steeping]　</a>　（<a href="https://i2.wp.com/live-labo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_1814.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1">alt 1</a>) (<a href="https://cdn.clipkit.co/tenants/820/item_images/images/000/006/251/large/448d6e79-9796-455a-bff1-64252ca49697.jpg?1602048705">alt 2</a>) (<a href="https://www.nanbubijin.co.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kodawari_kome_img5.jpg">alt 3</a>)</p>
<p>There are formulas being developed by researchers that can help predict this timing, but it is very complicated because of the variations in grains, polishing amount, etc. For most, if not all, brewers timing must be determined through trial and error by using small samples in the example above to determine the desired absorption amount.</p>
<p><i>Washing the rice</i></p>
<p>Once the timing is determined, the dry rice is split up, by weighing it on a scale, typically into 10-20 kg <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/UfJ38xy7fuhNSamSXuzz4mXepb0kAFTWrKBjOSkaSODC-nCbU4EaqA4jCll00uFbtFnKkBjIOihYmu59_u6-_2kPE2WKURLkSKqApZ8c">porous bags</a>, <a href="https://www.gekkeikan.co.jp/enjoy/sake/brewing/images/brewing02_p04.jpg">wicker</a>, &nbsp;or <a href="https://www.nanbubijin.co.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kodawari_kome_img4.jpg">wire-mesh</a> containers for more delicate, higher-end sake (tokutei-meishushu) that requires more attention to detail, but there are many automated procedures or large scale operations that are done with <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_s/286.html">bulk-rice washing machines</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For high-end sake, the bags may be placed in tubs of water where kura-bito will gently move the rice around to dislodge the particles clinging to the rice. Some breweries will use small, automated machines to carry out this process using a whirlpool-like action inside a tank and in very large facilities, the rice can be washed by&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the washing is considered thorough, the water will not be totally clear, but in an inch or two of water, you should be able to make out the grains quite clearly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a brewery, the Toji will instruct everyone when to pull the rice out of the water, and at that point a hose is sprayed over the baskets to free any remaining powder.</p>
<p>Here is a video of kurabito <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SAoPni74Bs">washing rice</a> together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Rice Steeping / Soaking / Immersion&nbsp;</strong></h6>
<p>Important Details:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rice: polishing amount, moisture content, storage temperature</li>
  <li>Water: temperature, mineral content</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The point of steeping</strong> the rice in water is to homogenize the “cooking” which is performed by steaming. If steam were simply applied to dry rice it would cook unevenly and it would not properly gelatinize all the starch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gelatinization improves the availability of starch for amylase hydrolysis (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch_gelatinization#:~:text=High%20amylose%20starches%20require%20more,roux%2C%20sauce%2C%20or%20soup.">source</a>). As will be mentioned many times on this site, amylase or glucoamylaze are enzymes produced by Koji mold, which break down this starch into simpler sugars, which will be consumed by Yeast and metabolized into alcohol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other factors are at play during the washing and steeping phase as well. “20-40% of the potassium and 20% of the phosphate, which activate fermentation, are washed out of the kernel, along with small amounts of sodium, magnesium, sugars, proteins, amino acids, and lipids. However, ferruginous ions and calcium are absorbed by the rice if they are present in the water.”, Brewing Society &nbsp;Calcium accelerates the modification of rice in a mash and ferruginous ions have a negative effect on the quality of sake, usually in the form of discoloration (iron)</p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_k/64.html">Koji-mai</a>, or rice that will be used for koji growing, soaking is a critical stage because if the rice absorbs too much moisture, it can cause the rice to become sticky and provide the wrong type of environment for koji mold to grow. If the rice doesn't absorb enough, it can also be problematic, because the koji mold requires a source of water to flourish. The target is usually 30% total moisture content (+/-30% Gautier, +/-33% Brewing Society), and it is extremely important to note that each rice batch (from the polishing mill, and each years harvest) will have a specific timing to reach this percentage.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_k/64.html">Kake-mai</a>, or rice that will make up the majority of the mash, the target water absorption is often lower because while we want the rice to gelatinize homogeneously during steaming, at a larger scale, the additional water in the rice can throw off calculations. As an example, kake-mai typically aims to absorb ( 30-35% Brewing Society, n/a Gautier)</p>
<p>There are many commercial processes for steeping rice including large vats, 10-30kg bags, and many home-made solutions that fit the needs of a brewery. In the home-brewing space, usually people just use mesh brew bags for beer brewing. Coarse mesh is the easiest to clean and allows water and bran to drain out more easily. Ideally most of the bran has been removed during the washing process, but there are always some residuals that cling to the rice.</p>
<p>In a commercial setting, if the batch is <i>not</i> for high-end ginjo or daiginjo sake, then timing is slightly less important. Large quantities of rice (100-300kg) might be placed into a large tank pre-filled with temperature controlled water, they wait for the pre-determined time to elapse for it to reach the expected absorption rate, and then the water is drained and the rice pumped via vacuum onto a conveyor belt, which brings the rice to the steamer.</p>
<p>When rice <i>is</i> used for high-end gingo and daiginjo sake, you will often find 10-30 kg bags are used to steep rice in tubs of water. This allows for control down to the second because of how quickly the water drains out of the porous bags. Toji (head brewer) will often stand over the kurabito (factory workers) with a stop watch and call out commands as each bag is being placed into and pulled out of the tub.</p>
<p>The homebrew method is very similar to this bag method. As mentioned above, using a simple mesh brew bag, you can fill a bucket with water and drop the bag in, wait for the pre-determined time, lift the whole bag out, and then moving on to letting it drain.</p>
<p><i>Process</i></p>
<p>In general, the process is the same regardless of scale.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the soak time determined above in the rice washing section, subtract the time you washed the rice, and assume that the remainder will be for soaking (steeping).</li>
  <li>Ensure the water you are going to put the rice into is the same temperature to prevent cracking,</li>
  <li>Place the bag(s) into the water and start your stop watch.</li>
  <li>When the time elapses, take the mesh bag out.</li>
  <li>Allow all the excess water to drain off (see the next step for more details)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of rice steeping:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OQi_Rnnj4">Eikun Sake Brewery</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baKlHR3LY98">Matsuse</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Rice Draining&nbsp;</h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of draining </strong>is the fast(er) removal of surface water that hangs on by capillary action, and further resting (covered in the next section) is what allows the water that's left on the surface and in the rice to diffuse into the grain and equilibrate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some breweries, and many home-brewers, use a conical funnel and a wet-vacuum to pull any surface water off the grains to prevent further absorption and ensure a specific rate of 30% (or whatever their target is). However, if you have a sieve (commonly used in cooking), put the rice into it and allow water to drain off the rice (tilting avoids any grains soaking in the water that collects at the bottom).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Post-Soak Resting (another Karashi)</h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of resting </strong>is to allow water absorbed from soaking to fully diffuse into the center of the grain, permeating the semi-crystalline starch structure of&nbsp;</p>
<p>When water is present at sufficient high temperatures (such as during the steaming process), the starch in the endosperm undergoes a gelatinization reaction. If the water does not fully diffuse ( If you don't allow the rice to sit long enough after the soak) it is possible that you will get grains after you steam with hard centers. This is not ideal for many reasons. The biggest is that those hard centers are not gelatinized and the koji spores will not be able to consume the starch. In addition to that, the rice will not liquify as easily, leaving a greater a mount kasu (lees) in the take afterward.</p>
<p>To ensure enough time to rest, once the rice is done soaking, hang the mesh bag (if you are using a sieve as described in the previous section tilt the sieve on it's side) and wait for <i>at least</i> 45-60 minutes. Many books discuss the practice of leaving the rice out overnight. This practice should be tested for your needs and environment to ensure you do not lose too much moisture to evaporation. If you weighed the dry rice, you can now weight it again to get a percentage of how much moisture is present after the soak. If you weigh it after 45 minutes, then after several hours, and then again overnight, you can get a sense of how much moisture is lost per hour and then adjust accordingly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Rice Steaming</strong></h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of steaming </strong>is to gelatinize the starch in the rice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will also increase the water content of the rice for koji-mai + moto making (41-43% Gautier + Brewing Society), kake-mai (39% Gautier, 39-40% brewing society). It is noted by the Brewing Society that these rates would be much lower for gingo-shu, but no information is provided. (few of us are still investigating this, but if you have information, please comment).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rice should exit the steamer at 100°C with a firm exterior and a bouncy, almost spring-like interior. It should not be too sticky, so ideally when it is picked up, some of the grains might stick together, but they shouldn't stick to your hand very well. If they do, they should fall off if you rub your hands together or touch them. If it is too early, the grains will be too try and unable to form a mochi-like mass when a few grains are pressed together. This is a test of sorts to determine the done-ness of the rice. If you take about 15-30 gains and smush them together, they should form a ball with a texture similar to gum. You can maybe stretch it to the size of a poker chip and give it a little tug with your fingers to see if it stretches. If you can still see the individual grains very clearly it is not ready. On the flip side, if you can see no gain definition at all, you might have over steamed the rice. It should not feel like putty. Typically this won't mean you make bad koji, but it could cause baka-haze if it was soaked for too long, and worse, it could allow bacterial to contaminate the grain because of the soft exterior. Koji-kin (spores) are able to penetrate the hard surface of well-steamed rice and bacteria and wild yeasts are not, but if you over steam the rice, you are giving them better chances of survival.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the rice cools again to about 29°C, it will have lost most of the water it absorbed during steaming, dropping it 10% from 40% down to 30% again with the only difference being the effects of gelatinization.</p>
<p><i>More on Gelatinization</i></p>
<p>Gelatinization provides an ideal condition for liquefaction and saccharification (depolymerization to a sweet-tasting product, similar to chewing rice and saliva breaks down the starch into simple sugars making it taste sweet ). Liquefaction is required for the particular enzymes to work because they perform hydrolysis (using water to break chemical bonds). Gelatinization transforms the partial crystalline structure of the starch granules. More specifically, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylose">amylose</a> [and Amylopectin] molecules leach out of the starch granule network and diffuse into the surrounding aqueous medium [(water)] outside the granules<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parboiled_rice#cite_note-Hermansson96-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> “. This has been correlated with the observed grain swelling that occurs during the steaming process, significantly increasing the volume of the rice. ”Amylose is the major factor influencing the physicochemical properties of rice starch. Upon heating in aqueous solutions, starch swells irreversibly and its crystalline structure collapses, a phenomenon known as gelatinization. Starch swelling is a property of amylopectin, whereas amylose has been known to restrict it (<a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2012.00193.x#b214"><strong><u>Tester and Morrison 1990a</u></strong></a>). Gelatinization converts starch into a physical form that is desirable in many food systems. … Upon cooling, starch molecules re-associate in a complex recrystallization process known as retrogradation, which is often associated with water separation from the gel (syneresis) (<a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2012.00193.x#b248"><strong><u>Yeh and Yeh 1993</u></strong></a>; <a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2012.00193.x#b70"><strong><u>Hoover and Manuel 1995</u></strong></a>). These changes may result in textural and visual gel deterioration (<a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2012.00193.x#b218"><strong><u>Thomas and Atwell 1999</u></strong></a>; <a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2012.00193.x#b49"><strong><u>Fredriksson and others 2000</u></strong></a>). The pasting properties are used in assessing the suitability of starch as a functional ingredient in food and other industrial products.", <a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2012.00193.x">source</a>.</p>

<h6><strong>Koji Making</strong></h6>
<p>The topic of koji making actually constitutes a large enough body of information to not only have it's own page, but it's own <a href="https://kojiwiki.com">WIKI</a> and many of us contribute to that as well. However, as sake is a very specific category, we will do our best to describe the difference and go over the basics so you can absorb the world of Koji a little easier.</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of making koji </strong>is to sake as malting grain is to beer brewing: to produce enzymes that will breakdown starch and produce simple sugars that yeast will consume and make ethanol (alcohol). It is however, a VERY different process for achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Background</i></p>
<p>In beer brewing, the grain is soaked in water in a controlled process that allows the seed to germinate. This activates natural enzymes which stimulate the creation of new enzymes. During the germination phase the grain is modified as rootlets emerge and the enzymes breakdown carbohydrates and proteins, which opens up the seeds' starch reserves. The grain is then dried in a kiln to stop the germination process, thereby ensuring the seed has plenty of starch left over. When the grain is later boiled in water to create beer wort, the high temperature of the water allows the enzymes to undergo hydrolysis, breaking down the starch reserves and creating simple sugars.</p>
<p>In sake brewing, the husk of the grain was shown to produce many unwanted flavors and so it is removed through the milling process. Therefore, it cannot simply be germinated like barley is in beer. To achieve the required enzymes, a special type of mold spore (usually of the Aspergillus Oryzae, Aspergillus Niger, or similar varieties) is inoculated onto steamed rice at about 29-33°C. The spore grows into the grain, consuming the starch, and producing alpha-amylase, beta-amylase, gamma-amylase, and glucoamylase enzymes. Different temperature ranges favor the production of one of each of these types. While the starch in these grains is broken down as well, the enzymes from the koji are released into the sake mash and continue to consume the starch from all the additional rice grains added in each of the brewing steps particular to sake.</p>
<p><i>Keep these in Mind:</i></p>
<p>We will go into much more detail on the process of koji making, but just so you have some bearings when you start down this path, Koji making is an art AND a science. There are aspects that are HIGHLY subjective and other that are very much objective. For instance… many charts (if you can find them… and we have found them for you) illustrate ideal temperature graphs. It will show a serious of time based temperature increases with beautiful arcs and no fuzzy fluctuations. There will be one mix around 10-12 hours, then another around 22, then 6-8 hours later and finally 6-8 hours after that. Each of these have a specific name and when 48 hours is elapsed, that moment is when you cool the koji down to stop its growth. This presents a problem for beginners for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>When you attempt to make koji, somethings will take a while to understand, but controlling the temperature is very difficult to master. When you see those pretty charts, you might think, “OH NO! I'm doing something totally wrong!”. And you may very well be, but that's usually not the case if you follow the basic process.</li>
  <li>If you don't know which koji spores they use, type of sake they are making, flavor profile they prefer, method they are using to make koji (there are many), or many other variables… than these charts mean nothing more than “an average". This is simply because everything you tweak will have a large impact, all the way down to what kind of materials you use to make the koji in. You could have good insulation, or bad insulation. You could do table koji or tray koji. There are some breweries that keep their koji chamber at a higher temperature than others. There are koji spores that can tolerate different temperature ranges and even generate more or less heat than others.</li>
  <li>Other factors start to come into play like humidity, type of cloth, heating source, room/chamber size, elevation/dryness, etc. In fact, Colorado's dry air makes it fairly necessary to use a plastic wrap of sorts to keep the rice from drying out too much during the incubation phase, while other areas in the country, under normal air conditions, might never need a tweak like this, but might struggle to dry out the room/chamber on the second day when we want to alter the koji's growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>These three items really do alter the production process immensely and there are more I'm sure aren't even included here. The point to take away is that when it comes to koji, growing it is more about which lever to pull to cause various things to change. I started <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i96o-xeljL3OpZhyMLzS_p9vt1Vc9YGiOuy0Pfk6ZJY/edit#heading=h.myd3v4vu65m3">making a list</a> of these to explain what those are.</p>
<p><i>Process&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Overview: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HYeJrHSl0P9jvGy3DFGIFoZYPKKF81_1L7HTiHLTQOY/edit">one person's cheat-sheet of step-by-step instruction reminders</a></p>
<p>The most important things to remember about the process of koji making are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Heat, Humidity, and Oxygen are the three largest levers you have to adjusting how you koji grows.</li>
  <li>Temperature ranges are about creating a flavor profile in your final sake. If you follow what you see on a chart very closely it will not product the “best koji” it will produce something similar to who ever made that chart. That might be more or less umami, more or less sweet… you don't really know the full picture, so don't treat it like a “bible” to go by, just think of charts as “guidelines”.</li>
  <li>What works for large scale production with NOT work for small scale, homebrew. If you are making 1-3kg of koji, the chamber you will need will probably be much smaller and everything from inoculation to temperature control will be very different that how it is done in large rooms with 100+kg of rice.</li>
  <li>If you let the rice get too hot or too cold, it will either die from too much heat or it will go dormant from too little. (The spores are pretty hardy though, so unless you let them get over 50°C, they should survive getting too cold or too hot, you'll just have to adjust the environment to get the koji back on track)</li>

<h6><strong>Moto</strong> (Shubo / Yeast Starter)</h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of making a moto ( also known as a shubo)</strong> is to grow up your yeast cell count and condition those yeast cells so they are healthy enough to withstand the osmotic pressure caused by a substantial sugar concentration in the moromi and the growing concentration of alcohol which is poisonous to the yeast cells (see: <a href="https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/DQXAk4DwuE/#:~:text=Autolysis%20is%20the%20final%20result,means%20%E2%80%9Cself%2Ddestruction.%E2%80%9D">autolysis</a>). In addition to fermentation benefits, a moto also has economical benefits, the most obvious is that you don't have to buy as much yeast. The moto is prepared before you start your main fermentation and can take 1-4 weeks to complete.</p>
<p><strong>An alternative to making a moto </strong>is a procedure called Kobo-shikomi, in which you just build up a large enough yeast cell concentration to add directly into the Hatsuzoe (soe). By doing this, it will be much more costly to make the batch, but will cut at least 1 week off your production calendar. However, it should be noted that there are adverse effects, such as removing the benefits of building up cell walls, and forcing a lot of stress on the yeast. This can be overcome to some degree by “over-pitching” (using much more than needed) your yeast, but that has other effects such as speeding up the ferment and causing high-acidity in your final sake. Compensating for these can be difficult and should be considered before choosing this method.<strong> </strong><i><strong>If you are making a home-brew size</strong></i><strong> </strong>that is less than 25L, you probably don't need any moto at all, because the cell concentration you are using from the ampules or pouches contains enough cells already and will likely not require any build up to achieve a successful fermentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>How to think about yeast pitches:</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What does Yeast Pitch mean?</strong> “Yeast pitch” in the fermentation world just means “amount and concentration of yeast you put into your fermentation”. As many sources will confirm, the concentration of yeast cells you are looking for by the end of your moto is 10^8 cells / mL. This just means that every milliliter of moto will contain 100,000,000 cells. If you were to buy a small vial of yeast it might cost $8-20 for 10 mL of cells. Wyeast and Whitelabs are two popular sites for purchasing yeast in the United States. Wyeast boasts <a href="https://c.tenor.com/Hi_MwCmaHIQAAAAC/finger-quotes.gif">100 Billion</a> Cells in their 125gram package. However, as yeast cells go, chances are 50% will be gone by the second day, so it's already like 50 Billion, and if it goes through the mail and sits in warm areas… you guessed it… probably a lot less. Cell death will cause off flavors in your sake, so preventing this is very important. Try to use yeast that is as fresh and healthy as possible.</p>
<p><strong>How do I order yeast?</strong> Yeast Pitch is often referred to in ways like “what is your yeast pitch size?" or “what is the cell concentration of your yeast pitch”. In the beer world, because fermentations were/are measured in Barrels, like some form of arcane throw back to the good ol' days, rather than switching to … <i>LITERS … </i>[end rant], you might read something like “we use a 15 bbl pitch”. This is basically referring to a scale of your fermentation. If you had a tank that held 15 barrels of wort, then that's what you would order for a style type of beer recipe and the yeast would be calculated so that when you poured it in, the concentration of cells would be enough to sufficiently ferment the sugars available in that volume of beer without becoming overwhelmed by faults listed above, such as autolysis. We're going to show you equivalents for things [INSERT LINK TO YEAST CALCULATOR], but because yeast suppliers typically supply commercial breweries in beer pitches, it's important to try to think in terms of liters and bbl ( "beer barrels" abbreviation ). 1 bbl is the same as 31 gallons / ~283.4 pints / ~117.3 liters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>How a moto is prepared:</strong></i></p>
<p>A moto is basically a small version of your fermentation. You provide it lots of oxygen through mixing it daily and that will allow the yeast to perform their aerobic metabolism (basically reproduction). This is different than the metabolic pathways that will create alcohol, but even if the majority of the yeast are performing aerobic fermentation, there are still others that are not, so alcohol will be produced regardless. This mostly has to do with how much free oxygen is suspended in the liquid. It's always important to remember that in any system, there are bound to be many different scenarios occurring at once, even if the document you read contains a more hyperbolized version of the events.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>Types of Moto (Shubo):</strong></i></p>
<p>There are three main types of yeast starters and one much less common these days. The most common today, Sokujo, is the most recently developed because it only existed since the discovery of microbiology, specifically the role that Lacto Bacillus plays in creating a favorable environment for growing yeast. In order of discovery (high-level descriptions):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type 1: <a href="https://www.skurnik.com/the-old-ways-bodaimoto-kimoto-yamahai/">Bodaimoto</a> - This is the earliest version of the modern yeast starter, which is differentiated from the subsequent iterations mainly in that is uses only steamed rice and water. There is no koji used <i>until</i> the main mash. After 3-8 days of letting this basically collect wild yeast and bacteria, the acidity will increase and you'll notice CO<sub>2</sub> bubbling up. At this point.. the mash is filtered to remove the rice, and now more cooked rice and rice-koji (you can grow koji spores on just about anything so we're just specifying) are added. After 6 more days, there should be enough yeast to begin the main mash.</li>
  <li>Type 2: <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_k/181.html">Kimoto</a> (生酛) - About 300 year later, someone figured out if you put steamed rice, water, and koji in it and then mix the contents with poles to add oxygen everyday, the mixture seemed to have less off flavors, which had occurred because bodaimoto was basically allowing anything to grow and even in modern times, many of the temples that make it in Japan throw out a bunch of them because you just never know what's going to overtake everything else biologically. With Kimoto, the big difference is of course the addition of Koji early on. I'm still looking for a reference that calls this out specifically, but my hunch is that the presence of koji enzymes breaks down the rice faster, releasing sugar and amino acids into the macerated liquid and denitrifying bacteria happen to benefit from this mixture, ultimately outpacing the growth of other unwanted organisms. But, basically, that is the major technological advancement here. Because there are less nitrates because the aforementioned bacteria has quickly transformed them into nitrites. Oddly enough, the nitrites are not only toxic for themselves, so that particular bacteria will die off, but also for other non-sake yeasts as well. At this point, lacto bacillus has produced enough lactic acid to lower the pH and the yeast can proceed to replicate themselves. Kimoto can take about 4 weeks to complete and THEN you need to make sake, so it's quite the process.</li>
  <li>Type 3: <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_y/187.html">Yamahai</a> (山廃) - Another 300 years pass before a Japan got super serious about science and Professor Kinichiro Kagi discovered that you <i>DID NOT</i> need to smash the contents with poles in order to make yeast grow. I'm sure there were plenty of kurabito that were rolling in there grave when at all the endless hours spend mixing for seemingly no reason, some brewers however, still continue the practice, and it is believed that there are other qualities that are developed through the Kimoto method that Yamahai doesn't offer, but I'd love to read a paper that describes it. Yamahai is also about 4 weeks, you just don't need to smash rice while it happens.&nbsp;<br>[ Need to update this based on Kimoto: Raising Wee Beasties, Sake Deep Dive ]&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Type 4: <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_s/179.html">Sokujo</a> (速醸) - So, as one might imagine, as soon as it was realized that “pole-ramming” wasn't necessary to propagate yeast, it was also discovered that you could grow lactic acid, add a certain amount to the rice, water, and koji, and it would drop the pH low enough that you didn't even need to wait for lactic bacteria to do it for you. So 21-28 days became 5-10 days and the Sokujo moto was born. About 99% of all sake made uses this procedure and its not just because it is easier, it also has a drastic effect on flavor and reliability.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>Role of pH in Moto</strong></i></p>
<p>Most micro-organisms have ideal environments that they flourish in. For sake yeast, it just so happens, they can flourish in a very wide range, as can Aspergillus Oryzae. Most bacteria and yeasts which are just floating out there in the air, cannot. Given that the point of a moto is to increase our yeast cells, we want to give they the best chance we can. If other organisms existed at the same time, they would eat the nutrients we want to feel to yeasts and not only would that mean we'd have less yeast cells, but we'd also have other bacteria cohabitating. If you have never tried to capture your own yeast, you might not have tried some of the products that these organisms produce, but some can even make alcohol, acids, etc. These can be lovely at times, but more often than not, they produce very unwanted smells and flavors.</p>
<p>By lowering the pH to around 4.5 or even 3.8, we allow the sake yeast to perform it's metabolism unimpeded, growing a dense cell culture and preparing for the main mash. This topic leads into the purpose of “San-Dan-Shikomi" or "three stage preparation", because it was calculated that by building the mash slowly, it gives time for the yeast to propagate without diluting the pH too much. If the moto was added to a full tank all at once it would be at risk of contamination again. We could technically add more lactic acid, but that would produce unwanted flavors. Rather, we just keep the pH low and the yeast will replicate by the time we get to the next addition. Once yeast have eaten all the nutrients other micro-organisms have a much more difficult time surviving.&nbsp;</p>

<h6><strong>San-Dan-Shikomi</strong> (Three Additions)</h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of San-Dan-Shikomi </strong>is<strong> </strong>to continue building up your yeast population, which will prevent other micro-organisms from contaminating the mash, which is basically an ideal, extremely nutrient rich pool for just about all of them. On a home-brew scale (&lt;25L) this can be scaled back to about two additions or even one because there is far less surface area exposed to the air and if you practice good sanitation it should be okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This basic method is what lays the foundation for an open fermentation. When yeast is added, it often needs time to build up it's&nbsp;</p>

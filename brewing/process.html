<h2><strong>Process Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Sake is a brewed beverage, using a different process than beer, and should also not be confused with wine making. If you want to learn more, see <a href="/brewing">Sake Brewing: Overview</a>.</p>
<p>The process begins by harvesting, milling, and polishing rice down to a specified percentage. After polishing, the rice is left to absorb ambient moisture from the air, a process referred to as <i>karashi</i>.</p>
<p>The Tōji will conduct tests on the rice to determine how long to soak the rice for and then the task of washing, steeping, and finally steaming the rice begins. They are exhaustive tasks which repeat each day during the sake brewing season. About 25-35% of the rice is then taken into a special room called the koji-mura, where it will be used to make Koji.</p>
<p>For 2-4 weeks a small portion of koji, rice, yeast, and water will be fermented in a relatively small container (1/10 - 1/8th the total size) which will allow yeast cells to replicate and prepare for the immense quadrupling of volume to come. When this <i>moto</i>, also known as <i>shubo</i> (酒母 - lit. “sake mother”) is ready, it is placed into a much larger container and for 3 days koji, rice, and water are added, doubling the size each day, until the main fermentation begins.</p>
<p>This main fermentation, known in beer as the <i>mash</i>, is referred to as the <i>moromi.</i> The moromi will be closely monitored over 25-55 days, as the temperature rises naturally, but also using various warming and cooling methods, to achieve the desired flavors, aromas, and alcohol levels. Just before the fermentation is complete, there are a few optional steps that can be completed at this time. A fourth-addition, to add sweetness, and also brewer's alcohol, which can be used to achieve specific flavors and body.</p>
<p>When the main fermentation is complete, the moromi is pressed using one of several methods and the resulting liquid is sake. As fresh as it gets. The remaining sediments are removed using racking methods similar to other brewing processes, and then there are a number of optional steps such as micro-filtering and pasteurization.</p>
<p>Sake will usually stay in a cool room, in a bottle or stored in tanks for months before being shipped.</p>
<p>We will go into exhaustive detail about these processes below and in sub-pages, links, and images so you have an idea of what this should look like and how it all comes together. As a home-brewer, you might find that many images don't always match what you will be working with. We'll do our best to give both examples so you can see how that</p>
<h2>Step By Step</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Rice Growing</strong></h6>
<p>Even before a single <a href="https://www.urbansake.com/sake-101/sake-glossary/kurabito/">kura-bito</a> puts their hands on a single grain of rice, there are many farmers, companies, organizations, and even governments involved in producing rice that will eventually end up in a sake brewery or “sakagura” (蔵). Rice is one of the oldest cultivated crops in the world and as such, humans have found plenty of ways to improve upon varieties: hybrids, selective cultivation, genetic engineering, etc. There are rice paddies that have even found a symbiotic relationship with ducks to eliminate pests and of course one of the earliest developments most of us are aware of is flooding the fields to prevent other plants from growing and protect the stalks from potential predators.</p>
<p>In Japan, the Japonica rice varietal has been crossbred and selectively grown for so long that there are over a hundred sake rice varieties currently grown today. For a detailed description of these, see <a href="/education/resources">Resources: Rice</a></p>
<p>Rice growing seasons vary, and that can actually be a factor in choosing what kind of rice to use. For Japanese brewers and even those in the United States, Yamada Nishiki is by far the most popular. Details such as shorter growing season will mean that the chance of a crop not falling victim to a typhoon or other natural disaster is far less. The size and shape of the grain is analyzed. The moisture content of the grain at harvest can even be a factor in the final selection.</p>
<p>Size and shape of the grain play a huge roll in the potential of the sake it will produce because of the biological and chemical makeup of a rice grain. Lipids (fats), Proteins, and Starches are the key components that can greatly affect an ability to make quality Koji, provide sugars for the yeast, and cold produce wanted (and unwanted) flavors and aromas.</p>
<p>Even the weather can effect the ultimate sake quality and properties. Experienced brewers have to account for these challenges in the following steps and it is the most skilled that will produce award winning sake.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of rice being grown and harvested:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Rice Milling &amp; Polishing</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Milling</strong></p>
<p>When rice is harvested from a field, it is very similar to most other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal">cereal</a> grains like wheat, millet, barley, oats, or corn. It needs to have the husk of the grain removed, which is expectedly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_huller">rice husking or rice hulling</a> and the technology has improved markedly over the years from hand husking against a rough stone, to machines which can not only hull the grain, but will remove dirt, and separate out the broken grains so that the final product is extremely pure in whole grains. Usually, in addition to the initial husk, about 10% of the grain is also removed. Most people will be surprised to know that all rice is originally brown rice and by taking away this initial percentage of the grain (the bran layer) we expose the white portion, far less rich in proteins and lipids than with the husk present. In sake production, this portion of the process is known as milling. From here, other machines will remove more of the grain as specified by the brewer. Some brewers even have their own on-site machines to do this on site.</p>
<p>Here is an example in Japan of rice milling at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr-eRU8WQgg">JRE</a> and another from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhA1GlH-cU0">Isabel Farms</a> in the US</p>
<p><strong>Polishing</strong></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://web-japan.org/nipponia/nipponia44/images/feature/05_01.jpg" alt="Polished Rice"></figure>
<p><span class="text-tiny">Levels of Polishing: (</span><a href="https://web-japan.org/nipponia/nipponia44/en/feature/feature05.html"><span class="text-tiny">source</span></a><span class="text-tiny">)</span></p>
<p><br>Once the milling being and as the polishing machines take over to complete the work, the remaining percentage of rice is stated using the term <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_s/84.html">seimai buai</a> (精米歩合). It literally means “rice polishing ratio”. For most high-quality sake, it usually ends up being 40-85% remaining. Meaning 15-60% of the rice has been removed. The number usually starts around 90%, which is what the milling company produces, before it begins the polishing process.</p>
<p>This simple choice of made by the <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_t/437.html">Tōji</a> on “how much of the grain to keep”, will effect just about every stage of the process to come, impacting timing, temperatures, acidity, taste, aroma, composition, food paring, marketing, and many other aspects.</p>
<p>Polishing is a very complicated process, and only about 2 companies in the world specialize in machinery that can polish rice. Since 1575, the technology has been improving, and in the early 1900s, it became possible to remove 40% of the rice, giving birth to a highly-refined (clean taste) sake. 60% seimai buai (40% removed) would become known later as Ginjo sake and is one of the main reasons this section's importance can not be understated. Breweries have in fact managed to produce sake with &lt;1% seimai buai, which, if you consider the physics of removing that much rice, means you need to use almost 100x as much rice to produce the same amount of sake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Karashi ("resting" after polishing)</strong></h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of the Karashi period</strong> is to accumulate moisture lost during the polishing process. The reason this requirement exists at all is due to how much heat is generated during the polishing process as the grains rub against the grinding stone and each other. The extra heat causes the moisture to evaporate out of the rice, but this also means the grains are more brittle as a result.</p>
<p>This is a time of 2-14 days that brewers let newly polished rice sit in porous ~50Lb bags in the open air in the factory. By allowing them to rest for a few days, they will absorb this moisture back into the grains and at that point the Toji can decide if they are ready to begin washing. Usually they will measure the moisture in the grains to see if it has returned to about 13-18%, which is equivalent to about how much is in them when they are harvested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Rice Washing (</strong><a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_s/94.html">洗米</a> sen-mai)</h6>
<p>The purpose of rice washing is to remove the rice brain (nuka) that accumulates during the polishing process. Mostly this clings to the rice grains via static or other</p>
<p>Important Details:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rice: polishing amount (seimai buai), moisture content, storage temperature</li>
  <li>Water: temperature, mineral content</li>
</ul>
<p>Washing the rice is the next critical step, especially when dealing with highly polished rice. If you were to make rice at home for cooking, it is usually recommended to wash it several times, allowing the water to drain and then repeat a few times before moving on to the cooking phase. This is because of the sediments, milling powder, and other potential flour-like material that is clinging to the rice from the milling process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At home, this process isn't very risky due to the low amount of polishing that table/sushi rice has. 90% seimai buai usually will take quite a while to absorb water, so you might wash for 10 minutes and that would not really effect the outcome. However, in the world of sake brewing, with rice that has been polished much more (only 35-70% remaining), the process becomes a time-critical experience that many commercial breweries actually use automated machines. This is because how quickly the soft, starchy center of sake rice absorbs water, compared to the protein and lipid rich outer layers.</p>
<p>With the steps that follow, the importance of water absorption rate will becoming increasingly clear, especially as you try to make your own koji. Brewers attempt to hit a total water content of 28-34% in the rice. With highly polished rice, the absorption rate could be so fast that after just 1-3 minutes it goes from 15% to 25%. If you took 10 minutes to wash, this would actually cause the rice to absorb all the necessary water, but it could actually absorb MORE than is desired, leading to soggy grains, which is absolutely the worst state a grain can be in heading into steaming or koji making.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that water temperature will play a huge role here as well. You want to try to reduce the amount of grains that split open (crack) during washing and steeping. One huge component of that is ensuring that the temperature of the water matches the temperature of the rice (usually these fall within 8-12°C) The homogenous environment greatly reduces the likelihood of the sudden exposure to cold temps cracking the rice.</p>
<p>Another key factor is actually how the rice is washed. While it might feel natural to move your hands rigorously, it is far more of a gentle motion, simply to free the stuck powder, and not to induce any intense rubbing together of the grains, which could lead to cracking as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Determining the Water Absorption Rate</i></p>
<p>Usually the head-brewer, or who ever is skilled in this particular task of judging the water absorption, will take a small sample of each batch of rice that came from the polisher and do an absorption test with a stop-watch. Theoretically all the rice of a particular varietal was being polished at the same time, was also from the same field, and also had the same polishing rate, so it should react the same to water. Any variation in these should have separate tests to determine how each batch will absorb water differently.</p>
<p>To conduct this test, the brewer will place rice grains on a small black plate or cup ( dark color is for contrast against the white rice ) and start a stop-watch as soon as it is immersed in water. The experience of the brewer is such that they can almost tell the exact moment the rice has absorbed enough, just by the sight of it:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.clipkit.co/tenants/820/articles/images/000/000/182/original/12153bed-1929-42ef-8e8c-b6bda1ef31a7.jpg?1602048421">[insert image of rice at point of finished steeping]　</a>　（<a href="https://i2.wp.com/live-labo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_1814.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1">alt 1</a>) (<a href="https://cdn.clipkit.co/tenants/820/item_images/images/000/006/251/large/448d6e79-9796-455a-bff1-64252ca49697.jpg?1602048705">alt 2</a>) (<a href="https://www.nanbubijin.co.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kodawari_kome_img5.jpg">alt 3</a>)</p>
<p>There are formulas being developed by researchers that can help predict this timing, but it is very complicated because of the variations in grains, polishing amount, etc. For most, if not all, brewers timing must be determined through trial and error by using small samples in the example above to determine the desired absorption amount.</p>
<p><i>Washing the rice</i></p>
<p>Once the timing is determined, the dry rice is split up, by weighing it on a scale, typically into 10-20 kg <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/UfJ38xy7fuhNSamSXuzz4mXepb0kAFTWrKBjOSkaSODC-nCbU4EaqA4jCll00uFbtFnKkBjIOihYmu59_u6-_2kPE2WKURLkSKqApZ8c">porous bags</a>, <a href="https://www.gekkeikan.co.jp/enjoy/sake/brewing/images/brewing02_p04.jpg">wicker</a>, &nbsp;or <a href="https://www.nanbubijin.co.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kodawari_kome_img4.jpg">wire-mesh</a> containers for more delicate, higher-end sake (tokutei-meishushu) that requires more attention to detail, but there are many automated procedures or large scale operations that are done with <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_s/286.html">bulk-rice washing machines</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For high-end sake, the bags may be placed in tubs of water where kura-bito will gently move the rice around to dislodge the particles clinging to the rice. Some breweries will use small, automated machines to carry out this process using a whirlpool-like action inside a tank and in very large facilities, the rice can be washed by&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the washing is considered thorough, the water will not be totally clear, but in an inch or two of water, you should be able to make out the grains quite clearly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a brewery, the Toji will instruct everyone when to pull the rice out of the water, and at that point a hose is sprayed over the baskets to free any remaining powder.</p>
<p>Here is a video of kurabito <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SAoPni74Bs">washing rice</a> together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Rice Steeping / Soaking / Immersion&nbsp;</strong></h6>
<p>Important Details:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rice: polishing amount, moisture content, storage temperature</li>
  <li>Water: temperature, mineral content</li>
</ul>
<p>The point of steeping the rice in water is to homogenize the cooking. If steam were simply applied to dry rice it would cook unevenly and it would not properly gelatinize the starch. &nbsp;Gelatinization improves the availability of starch for amylase hydrolysis (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch_gelatinization#:~:text=High%20amylose%20starches%20require%20more,roux%2C%20sauce%2C%20or%20soup.">source</a>). As will be mentioned many times on this size, amylase or glucoamylaze are enzymes produced by Koji mold, which break down this starch into simpler sugars, which will be consumed by Yeast and metabolized into alcohol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other factors are at play during the washing and steeping phase as well. “20-40% of the potassium and 20% of the phosphate, which activate fermentation, are washed out of the kernel, along with small amounts of sodium, magnesium, sugars, proteins, amino acids, and lipids. However, ferruginous ions and calcium are absorbed by the rice if they are present in the water.”, Brewing Society &nbsp;Calcium accelerates the modification of rice in a mash and ferruginous ions have a negative effect on the quality of sake, usually in the form of discoloration (iron)</p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_k/64.html">Koji-mai</a>, or rice that will be used for koji growing, soaking is a critical stage because if the rice absorbs too much moisture, it can cause the rice to become sticky and provide the wrong type of environment for koji mold to grow. If the rice doesn't absorb enough, it can also be problematic, because the koji mold requires a source of water to flourish. The target is usually 30% total moisture content (+/-30% Gautier, +/-33% Brewing Society), and it is extremely important to note that each rice batch (from the polishing mill, and each years harvest) will have a specific timing to reach this percentage.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_k/64.html">Kake-mai</a>, or rice that will make up the majority of the mash, the target water absorption is often lower because while we want the rice to gelatinize homogeneously during steaming, at a larger scale, the additional water in the rice can throw off calculations. As an example, kake-mai typically aims to absorb ( 30-35% Brewing Society, n/a Gautier)</p>
<p>There are many commercial processes for steeping rice including large vats, 10-30kg bags, and many home-made solutions that fit the needs of a brewery. In the home-brewing space, usually people just use mesh brew bags for beer brewing. Coarse mesh is the easiest to clean and allows water and bran to drain out more easily. Ideally most of the bran has been removed during the washing process, but there are always some residuals that cling to the rice.</p>
<p>In a commercial setting, if the batch is <i>not</i> for high-end ginjo or daiginjo sake, then timing is slightly less important. Large quantities of rice (100-300kg) might be placed into a large tank pre-filled with temperature controlled water, they wait for the pre-determined time to elapse for it to reach the expected absorption rate, and then the water is drained and the rice pumped via vacuum onto a conveyor belt, which brings the rice to the steamer.</p>
<p>When rice <i>is</i> used for high-end gingo and daiginjo sake, you will often find 10-30 kg bags are used to steep rice in tubs of water. This allows for control down to the second because of how quickly the water drains out of the porous bags. Toji (head brewer) will often stand over the kurabito (factory workers) with a stop watch and call out commands as each bag is being placed into and pulled out of the tub.</p>
<p>The homebrew method is very similar to this bag method. As mentioned above, using a simple mesh brew bag, you can fill a bucket with water and drop the bag in, wait for the pre-determined time, lift the whole bag out, and then moving on to letting it drain.</p>
<p><i>Process</i></p>
<p>In general, the process is the same regardless of scale. Using the soak time determined above in the rice washing section, subtract the time you washed the rice, and assume that the remainder will be for soaking (steeping). Ensure the water you are going to put the rice into is the same temperature to prevent cracking, and then place the bag(s) in as you start your stop watch. When the time elapses, take the mesh bag out and place it on a drying rack. Alternatively, a little trick from the industry is using a shop vacuum attached to a funnel which can pull the water off the rice faster in about 1-2 minutes.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of rice steeping:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-OQi_Rnnj4">Eikun Sake Brewery</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Rice Draining&nbsp;</h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of draining </strong>is the fast(er) removal of surface water that hangs on by capillary action, and further resting (covered in the next section) is what allows the water that's left on the surface and in the rice to diffuse into the grain and equilibrate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some breweries, and many home-brewers, use a conical funnel and a wet-vacuum to pull any surface water off the grains to prevent further absorption and ensure a specific rate of 30% (or whatever their target is). However, if you have a sieve (commonly used in cooking), put the rice into it and allow water to drain off the rice (tilting avoids any grains soaking in the water that collects at the bottom).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Post-Soak Resting (another Karashi)</h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of resting </strong>is to allow water absorbed from soaking to fully diffuse into the center of the grain, permeating the semi-crystalline starch structure of&nbsp;</p>
<p>When water is present at sufficient high temperatures (such as during the steaming process), the starch in the endosperm undergoes a gelatinization reaction. If the water does not fully diffuse ( If you don't allow the rice to sit long enough after the soak) it is possible that you will get grains after you steam with hard centers. This is not ideal for many reasons. The biggest is that those hard centers are not gelatinized and the koji spores will not be able to consume the starch. In addition to that, the rice will not liquify as easily, leaving a greater a mount kasu (lees) in the take afterward.</p>
<p>To ensure enough time to rest, once the rice is done soaking, hang the mesh bag (if you are using a sieve as described in the previous section tilt the sieve on it's side) and wait for <i>at least</i> 45-60 minutes. Many books discuss the practice of leaving the rice out overnight. This practice should be tested for your needs and environment to ensure you do not lose too much moisture to evaporation. If you weighed the dry rice, you can now weight it again to get a percentage of how much moisture is present after the soak. If you weigh it after 45 minutes, then after several hours, and then again overnight, you can get a sense of how much moisture is lost per hour and then adjust accordingly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Rice Steaming</strong></h6>
<p><strong>The purpose of steaming </strong>is to gelatinize the starch in the rice, transforming the partial crystalline structure of the starch granules. More specifically, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylose">amylose</a> molecules leach out of the starch granule network and diffuse into the surrounding aqueous medium outside the granules<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parboiled_rice#cite_note-Hermansson96-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> ". This means&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post steaming absorption rates for koji-mai + moto making (41-43% Gautier + Brewing Society), kake-mai (39% Gautier, 39-40% brewing society). It is noted by the Brewing Society that these rates would be much lower for gingo-shu, but no information is provided. (few of us are still investigating this, but if you have information, please comment)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h6><strong>Koji Making</strong></h6>
<p>The topic of koji making actually constitutes a large enough body of information to not only have it's own page, but it's own <a href="https://kojiwiki.com">WIKI</a> and many of us contribute to that as well. However, as sake is a very specific category, we will do our best to describe the difference and go over the basics so you can absorb the world of Koji a little easier.</p>

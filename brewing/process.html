<h2><strong>Process Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Sake is a brewed beverage, using a different process than beer, and should also not be confused with wine making. If you want to learn more, see <a href="/brewing">Sake Brewing: Overview</a>.</p>
<p>The process begins by harvesting, milling, and polishing rice down to a specified percentage. After</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step By Step</h2>
<p><strong>Rice Growing</strong></p>
<p>Even before a single <a href="https://www.urbansake.com/sake-101/sake-glossary/kurabito/">kura-bito</a> puts their hands on a single grain of rice, there are many farmers, companies, organizations, and even governments involved in producing rice that will eventually end up in a sake brewery or “sakagura” (蔵)</p>
<p><strong>Rice Milling &amp; Polishin</strong></p>
<p>When rice is harvested from a field, it is very similar to most other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal">cereal</a> grains like wheat, millet, barley, oats, or corn. The remaining percentage of rice is known as <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_s/84.html">sei-mai buai</a> (精米歩合). For most high-quality sake, it usually ends up being 40-85% remaining. Meaning 15-60% of the rice has been removed. This simple choice made by the <a href="http://www.nada-ken.com/main/en/index_t/437.html">Tōji</a> on how much polishing to use, it will effect just about every stage of the process to come, impacting timing, temperatures, acidity, taste, aroma, composition, food paring, marketing, and many other aspects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When rice is harvested it needs to have the husk of the grain removed. This is known as&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Karashi</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rice Washing</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rice Steeping</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rice Steaming</strong></p>
<p><strong>Koji Making</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moto</strong> (Shubo / Yeast Starter)</p>
<p><strong>Moromi</strong> (Main Mash / Primary Fermentation)</p>
<p><strong>Pressing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Racking</strong></p>
<p><strong>Filtering</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pasteurization</strong> (First Pasteurization)</p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>This wiki is a labor of love from a group of home brewers who are extremely dedicated to bringing the joy of sake to the English speaking world. We truly hope you can use this information to skip over the countless hours we have spent scouring the world for books, articles, and media that will shed a little more light on the wonderful art of sake brewing.</p>
<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>
<p>There are some amazing resources out there and we'll point you at them. However, as we found on our journeys, there are a lot of blind spots. Even the best books can't provide every example or comparative measure. These can be critical to establishing a firm understanding of what ranges make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Involved</strong></p>
<p>Join our efforts to build this database of resources. We need researchers, translators, mycologists, biologists, engineers, brewers, designers, and more. Ask questions (however silly you think they might be), point out mistakes, and contribute new information.</p>

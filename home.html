<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This wiki is a labor of love from a group of home brewers who are extremely dedicated to bringing the joy of sake to the English speaking world. We truly hope you can use this information to skip over the countless hours we have spent scouring the world for books, articles, and media that will shed a little more light on the wonderful art of sake brewing.</p>
<p>This little project got started in Sept 2021, so if it's a little bare, just hold on. You're always free to update pages or add where necessary, but please make sure you are not duplicating anything so we don't have lost data and ALWAYS make sure you cite any references you are using. People deserve credit for what they have done and we'll make sure any source we pull from benefits at least from the increased SEO / Google rankings, but we'd hope to drive more people to products and research materials they might not already be aware of.</p>
<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>
<p>There are some amazing resources out there and we'll point you at them. However, as we found on our journeys, there are a lot of blind spots. Even the best books can't provide every example or comparative measure. These can be critical to establishing a firm understanding of what ranges make sense.</p>
<p>Eventually we'd like to post or link to video series that can really show you what home brewing looks like, but in the mean time, we'll link you to anything we find that can fill in another piece of the puzzle for you.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Involved</strong></p>
<p>Join our efforts to build this database of resources. We need researchers, translators, mycologists, biologists, engineers, brewers, designers, and more. Ask questions (however silly you think they might be), point out mistakes, and contribute new information.</p>

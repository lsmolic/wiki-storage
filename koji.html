<h1>Koji</h1>
<h2>What is Koji</h2>
<p>Koji is rice that has had aspergillus oryzae mold spores (aka. koji-kin or tane-koji) grown on it. Koji growth produces various enzymes, usually glucoamylase or protease, which will break down the starch in rice grains so that yeast can convert it into alcohol.</p>

<h2>How to make koji</h2>
<p>A note: Timing, Temps, and Humidity can all change based on the type of koji-kin.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PREP</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>weigh dry rice</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Separate out 100g of rice into a separate cup that I can constantly drain and weigh so I can track the water absorption, but this can also just be done in advance of the full rice quantity.</li>
          <li>weigh wet rice to determine time to 30-35% absorption<ul>
              <li>soak the rice quickly and then drain the water off. this weight is the reference point when you check the values</li>
              <li>This doesn’t include post steam absorption, which would be closer to 40-42%. While the rice cools, it will return to about 35% from evaporation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>** Most rice starts at 13-18% moisture.<ul>
              <li>rice can contain moisture to start, you can put a sample in the oven to dry it out and weigh it a second time to determine the original moisture level in the rice. This will let you know the difference needed to achieve for the rest of the batch.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>洗米 (Senmai) - wash (try to keep to &lt; 5 min)<ul>
          <li>if the rice is milled more than 90% seimaibuai, track this time exactly</li>
          <li>be gentle when washing (avoid scraping the side of your container or mesh) to prevent breaking your rice</li>
          <li>if you can look through several inches of water and clearly make out the grains, it’s probably OK</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>浸漬 (Shinseki) - steep in cold water<ul>
          <li>strain and weigh the rice again to see how much has already been absorbed (repeat until the ideal number is reached)</li>
          <li>make sure you match the temperature of the rice to avoid cracking</li>
          <li>note the temperature of water you tested the absorption rate with so that it is as accurate as possible.</li>
          <li>かし Kashi - (check ability to crush into a powder)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>ザル上げ (zaruage) - drain the water<ul>
          <li>tip strainer at 45 degrees</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>からしい (resting) - allow the rice to sit after draining so that the surface water will drain and evaporate off, giving the grain a dryer surface.<ul>
          <li>the key point here is to remove as much surface water as possible so the rice doesn’t become mushy or sticky during steaming</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>蒸し (mushi) - steam the rice,<ul>
          <li>If over 2 KG, you can use 抜けがけ (nukegake), but it is not necessary. This is a traditional style of ensuring the rice steams evenly.</li>
          <li>Leave the rice uncovered and wait until the steam is coming through the top before starting your timer.</li>
          <li>Turn your heat down to 6.5 (or equivalent) to keep a low boil</li>
          <li>Use false rice at the bottom to prevent water from accumulating on the bottom</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>蒸しあがり (mushiaragi) - check the texture of the rice, using ひねりもち<ul>
          <li>mash a few grains into a ball or quarter-sized disc and check for a spongy or stretchy consistency (think silicone)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>蒸し取り(mushitori) - Rice From Steamer (+60-80C)</li>
      <li>Cool to less than 45C<ul>
          <li>35-40C is a safer range. 35C was recommended by Koichi Higuchi. Also you may add an optional rest stage here in order to dry the surface of the rice before inoculating.</li>
          <li>methods for cooling<ul>
              <li>use a fan to cool the rice</li>
              <li>put it in a pan, mix it and then return</li>
              <li>put it in the koji container to prime the humidity levels (slower)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>種切り (tanekiri) - Begin inoculating at 40C as it cools</li>
      <li>包み込み (tsutsumikomi) - Finish inoculating before it hits 30C and wrap in blanket.</li>
      <li><strong>Relative Humidity to 80-90%</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Keep incubator at 29-32C for 12-18 hours later (koji temp will rise to 34-38C)</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If humidity loss is a problem on day one, consider wrapping the koji in a plastic tarp or bag to contain the moisture.</li>
          <li>Don’t aim for quick growth, if the temp is rising toward 38-40C too quickly, then turn down the incubator to slow the growth. Aim for a gradual temp increase.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>12-18 hours</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>切り返し (kirikaeshi) - mix the rice to ensure even germination</li>
      <li><strong>&nbsp;the rice temperature begins slowly raising to 38-40C after mixing</strong></li>
      <li>!! If the temp approaches 42C, mix the rice to cool it down<ul>
          <li>NOTE: if your koji is approaching this before shimai-shigoto the ambient humidity might be too high.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>24 hours</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>reduce Relative Humidity to 50-70%</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>**No hard and fast numbers here since humidity depends on many factors. Dry environments might require elevated humidity to compensate.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>盛り (mori “heap”-shigoto) -, when the temp has risen to <strong>38-40C</strong>, transfer the rice into a try in a big <i><strong>heap</strong></i> and mix it, ideally 10-20% of the rice has mycelia growth visible.</li>
      <li>This will drop the temp during the mixing to<strong> 30C</strong> and it will need time to rise back to 36C.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>28-30 hours</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>仲仕事 (naka-shigoto) middle job, after the temperature returns to <strong>36C</strong>, mix the rice again.</li>
      <li>30-50% of the rice should show visible mycelia growth</li>
      <li>Again this will drop the temperature to <strong>32-34C</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>32-34 hours</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>仕舞仕事 (shimai-shigoto) end/final job, after the temp returns to 38C, mix it one last time.</li>
      <li>60-80% of the rice should show visible mycelia growth</li>
      <li>Temp will drop again post-mixing to <strong>34-36C</strong></li>
      <li>Make the 花道 (hana-michi) “flower road” to help disperse heat and oxygen</li>
      <li>最高気温をチェック (saikou-kion) - checking maximum temperature<ul>
          <li>maintain <strong>40-43C</strong> for the next 12 hours</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>48-60 hours (Dekoji)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>remove koji when fuzzy mycelia growth is covering 100% but BEFORE spores form.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cool the koji&nbsp;</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>put it in the fridge to prevent the koji from continuing to grow</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

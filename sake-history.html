<h1>Sake History</h1>
<ul>
  <li>4000-3000 BCE alcohol production and consumption begins</li>
  <li>1000 BCE - 100 C.E. Use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_oryzae">Aspergillus Oryzae</a> (<i>A. Oryzae</i>) begins in China. Cultivating this mold upon a substrate such as rice will produce <a href="https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/Do5AiUH8r0/">saccharifying</a> enzymes which break down the substrate into smaller molecules, which aid the fermentation process. When A. Oryzae is grown on rice, the resulting moldy rice becomes known as kōji <i>麹 &nbsp;( </i>Chinese:<i> qū </i>).</li>
  <li>400 BCE rice cultivation is introduced during migration from China and Korea, along with various brewing methods</li>
  <li>300 B.C.E. - 300 C.E. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_period">Yayoi Era</a>) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11532">Japonica</a> rice paddy fields are cultivated and an early form of sake is brewed for the local King, indicated by earthenware vessels discovered at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinogari_site">Yoshinogari</a> architectural site dating from the 1st to the 3rd century C.E. There are tales the mention the immigration of sake brewers to Japan at this time, but no specific records. <a href="https://www.wasshoimagazine.org/blog/discovering-japan/a-journey-through-history-yayoi-second-part-social-stratification">Chinese records</a> of the Japanese people consuming a lot of sake during this period was written in the book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Wei">Weizhi worenchuan</a> (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AD%8F%E5%BF%97%E5%80%AD%E4%BA%BA%E4%BC%9D">Japanese Wiki link</a>)”.</li>
  <li>300 C.E. - 400 C.E. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojiki">Kojiki</a> (<a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/k/images/2/2c/Kojiki_Chamberlain.pdf">pdf</a>), a published book in the 8th century, talks about a Korean immigrant sake brewer named <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/History%20of%20Sake%20(Japanese%20liquor).html">Susukori</a> who gained the favor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor%20Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a> with the beverage, but other sources indicate brewing had already begun throughout the country.</li>
  <li>500 C.E. Chinese records show recipes for Sake production and the creation of <i>Kōji</i> made from wheat flour. It is this that indicates whole grain kōji making must have been introduced to beforehand because hand-operated millstones were not yet in use in Japan.</li>
  <li>700 C.E. Annual sake production reaches 45 Kiloliters.</li>
  <li>900 C.E. Described in the historical text <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engishiki">Engishiki</a> (<a href="https://jhti.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/jhti/brows.cgi">translation</a>) in 927 CE, sake brewing was carried out without the Imperial Palace by Japanese officials, indicating that they are no longer reliant on immigrants for production. By this time, rice is being steamed and Kōji production is being made within a specialized room. 10 different kinds of sake are being produced at this time and used to celebrate various occasions. The Shiori brewing method, which used previously brewed sake in-place of water, however it was a form of brewing that has already become antiquated in China by the early 3rd century, which involved numerous repeated fermentations, using the previous filtered batch as the starting point for the next.</li>
  <li>1100-1300 C.E. (Heian era - Kamakura era) Lots of sake is brewed, but bottles are limited 1 per household to prevent a reduction in the fighting capabilities of the military. This is the first time professional Kōji making businesses appear.&nbsp;<br><br>The <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/sg/jbyj-blog/sudo-honke-japan-s-oldest-sake-brewery/">Sudo Honke</a> Sake Brewery is established, still Japan's oldest brewery, run by their 55th generation owner. It is also one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies">oldest companies in the world</a>.</li>
  <li>1300-1500 C.E. (Muromachi Era) Buddhist Temples begin brewing sake. Students studying Zen Buddhism were taught to brew sake and their access to new textbooks from China gave birth to Morohaku, or sake brewed with polished rice for both the main mash, as well as for koji. A second type, Katahaku, only used polished rice for the main mash. It was also during this time the <i>moto ( </i>酛 - literally "sake origin" or "yeast starter" )<i> </i>was invented and documented in a diary of brewing called “<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Goshu-no-nikki%20(The%20technical%20book%20on%20sake%20brewing).html"><i>Goshu no Nikki</i></a><i>" , </i>which described using a well-performing “mother culture” that where the ferment would be built up before additional koji and rice was added. As the liquid macerated rice, and the koji enzymes broke down the rice starch into sugars, it provided a nurturing environment for wild <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast">yeast</a> (a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus">fungus</a>) to fall in and begin to replicate in the open air environment. Some of the yeast strains, as the oxygen level dropped inside the mixture (<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/mash">mash</a>), would convert the recently created sugars into alcohol.<br><br>This practice was carried out in Bodaisen Shōreki-ji temples. 菩提山 is a mountain in China, where a temple was constructed and named after Bodhidharma, a scholar from India and the founder of Zen Buddhism. <i>Bodaisen</i> is the name given to the original formula that used only Rice, Water, and a bit of cooked rice. Eventually, when the practice of adding Steamed Rice and Kōji to the mixture was brought to Japan, the name was changed to Bodai-moto. &nbsp;<br><br>Bodai-moto, or Mizumoto named for the process of macerating rice, in water until it was a liquid before adding in the remainder of the additions. This method remains unchanged even today.</li>
